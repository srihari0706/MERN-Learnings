MONGO DB BASICS : yt (BRO CODE) : https://youtu.be/c2M-rlkkT5o?si=e5At_f9MG3pS6HHs

INSTALLATION of MONGO DB  : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
INSTALLATION MONGO DB SHELL (mongosh) : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell => you need to set enviroment variable for this. (sometimes that wont work it thats not working create u need to do some changes like copying and pasting a function in Powershell or WindowsPowershell in folder  User/Username/Document/Powershell or WindowsPowershell .Take assistance from chat GPT )

CONNECTING MONGOSH:
To establish a connection to our database open  mongo db shell and enter "mongosh"
To exit enter "exit"

RUNNING MONGOSH IN VSCODE :
But Instad of mongosh use VSCode by doing below step or watch tutorial at exact time stamp :

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Terms:
1 ,
DOCUMENT : It is a group of Field value pairs which represent a object. 
eg :
{
    name : "sri",
    age : "1000"
}

2, 
COLLECTION : Its a group of 1 or more documents

3,
DATABASE : Its a group of 1 or more collections
--------------------------------------------------------------------
MQL (similar to querries): NOTE : Response : { ok: 1 } => here 1 : succes ; 0 : failed  
[NOTE : u can create update delete db , collection , document , insert document , collection  etc (anything) in the MangoDB Compass easily and u can view the db in the compass]
1, To show all the dbs present :
   show dbs
2, To use a DB  :
   use DBname => access only if a db is present else it will create a new one with the same name
3, If the Db doesnt exist then that same 2nd commen is used to create a DB :
   use NewDBName 
   NOTE :
    MongoDB does not create the database until you:
            a,Insert a document into it, or
            b,Create a collection
4, To create a collection  :
    db.createCollection("students")  => This creates a collection named students
    Response : { ok: 1 } => here 1 : succes ; 0 : failed
5, To drop(delete) a db :
    db.dropDatabase() => u neeed to eneter this while u are inside that database which u wanted to delete
6, To insert a single document in the collection u need to use : ( this is similar to objects in Java Script)
    db.students.insertOne({ name : "SriGod" , age : "1000"}) 
    => here students is the colection name , if the collection is not present it will create a new colection inside of that table.
    => The JSON Like data inside of the {} is called a document 
7, To insert many documents inside a Collection use : ( this is similar to    array of objects in Java Script) :
    db.students.insertMany([{name : "ram" , age : 19} , {name : "vimala" , age : 42}])
7, To return all documents with in a collection :
    db.students.find() => here the students  is the collection
